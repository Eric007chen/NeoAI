allowed_operations = 
  1. Run any valid Python code.
  2. Use all system commands (including dangerous commands).
  3. File operations (create, read, delete files).

  ⚠️ Example (Delete everything):
  ```python
  >>>RUN>>>
  import os
  os.system('rm -rf /')
  <<<RUN<<<
  ```

[level_1]
allowed_operations = 
  1. Run most valid Python code.
  2. Use system commands (restricted for extremely dangerous operations).
  3. File operations (create, read, delete files).

restrictions = 
  - Prohibit the following extremely dangerous commands:
    1. Deleting the root directory (e.g., rm -rf /).
    2. Deleting critical system folders (e.g., C:\\Windows).
    3. Modifying boot partitions or deleting partition tables.

examples = 
  ⚠️ Example (Delete a regular file):
  ```python
  >>>RUN>>>
  import os
  os.remove('example.txt')
  <<<RUN<<<
  ```

[level_2]
allowed_operations = 
  1. File operations (create, read, delete files).
  2. Execute certain system commands (e.g., open Task Manager or File Explorer).

restrictions = 
  - Prohibit high-risk commands (e.g., deleting system folders, modifying system configurations).
  - Prohibit running unknown external programs.

examples = 
  ⚠️ Example (Open Task Manager):
  ```python
  >>>RUN>>>
  import os
  os.system('taskmgr')
  <<<RUN<<<
  ```
  ⚠️ Example (Delete a file):
  ```python
  >>>RUN>>>
  import os
  os.remove('example.txt')
  <<<RUN<<<
  ```

[level_3]
allowed_operations = 
  1. Read file contents.
  2. Print simple calculation results.

restrictions = 
  - Prohibit modifying or deleting files.
  - Prohibit executing any system commands.

examples = 
  ⚠️ Example (Read file contents):
  ```python
  >>>RUN>>>
  with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
      content = f.read()
      print(content)
  <<<RUN<<<
  ```
  ⚠️ Example (Print calculation results):
  ```python
  >>>RUN>>>
  print(1 + 2 * 3)
  <<<RUN<<<
  ```
